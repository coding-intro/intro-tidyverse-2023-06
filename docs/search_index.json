This website serves as the central repository for all course materials. Here, you will find all slides, lecture materials, and links to your online development environment. 0.1 Course Objective Most academic fields require proficiency in at least one data-centered analysis tool. For many, the R programming language has become the tool of choice. However, the first steps in coding can be intimidating and discouraging—especially if you have never worked with a programming language before. This course aims at providing a results-oriented, applied, and hands-on introduction to the most important parts of a Data Science project in R. We will not only introduce the libraries and frameworks necessary for your analysis, but also focus on teaching you the implementation and application of those tools with small examples that you can work on yourself. Our goal is to show you the scope of possibilities within R and leave you with the impression that you can confidently implement your own empirical projects in R. We will focus on the Tidyverse ecosystem, a consistent and intuitive framework for building your data analysis from start to finish. After the successful completion of this course, you know how to apply the basic Tidyverse tools for common Data Science tasks in R—primarily data wrangling, data visualization, and results communication. 0.2 Course Description We aim this course at beginners who are either entirely new to R as a programming language and/or want to learn about the Tidyverse ecosystem. The course covers four primary areas of the typical data science process and introduces the respective tidyverse tools: Plotting with ggplot2 Data wrangling with dplyr Communicating your results with R Markdown Regressions with tidymodels We will not cover statistical or theoretical concepts in this course, as the focus will lie on applied coding. 0.3 Methods We will let you eat cake first. What does that mean? Many programming courses start with the absolute basics — variable types, syntax, loops, etc. Those are important but quite dull in the beginning. Instead of monotonously walking you through those, we follow a different teaching philosophy. Each topic will start with a very friendly and sometimes a bit complicated cake. And you will dive right into it by executing and adapting the code for that “data science cake.” For example, we will show you an advanced visualization right at the beginning of the course and focus on what is possible eventually. While this might appear intimidating at first (“how should I ever be able to code that from scratch?”), we will walk you through the steps and introduce the methods to get there during the course. The course will alternate between short introductions to a concept or method and small do-it-yourself coding exercises. In between the three sessions, you are encouraged to work on provided exercises that further deepen your understanding. 0.4 Conditions This course is a beginner-friendly course. You do not need prior coding experience. But you are also more than welcome to participate if you are an experienced R user but want to learn more about the Tidyverse. You will need a Posit Cloud (formerly RStudio Cloud) account. Posit Cloud is a very convenient online integrated Development Environment, where we provide you with all the necessary code to follow the course and work with small application exercises on your own. By avoiding to install RStudio locally during the course, we can start right away with the more critical course content. If you already have set up a local installation of RStudio, you are, of course, more than welcome to use that instead. In this case, download the source files linked in the respective application exercises. Note that you won’t need to set anything up if you use Posit Cloud. Since we do not want to waste precious time on the technical setup, we will use the Posit Cloud as a simple—and already set up—development environment. We will send out detailed instructions and an invitation link in advance. 0.5 Course Organization We will meet on July 12th 2023 from 09:00 a.m. - 04:00 p.m in Seminarhaus, room 5.106 on Campus Westend (see map). A rough time table, depending on our progress: Part Date Time 1 12.07.2023 09:00 - 10:45 break 20 to 30min. 2 12.07.2023 11:15 - 13:00 lunch 13:00 - 14:00 3 12.07.2023 14:00 - 15:45 We want you to make your hands dirty — that means we want you to code! Just following along fancy slides won’t magically transfer the skill of coding to you. But you actively engaging with the course content in your development environment will more likely do just that. That’s why we need you to prepare accordingly: Try to follow the course with two screens or two devices (one for Zoom and the slides, and one for your browser with Posit Cloud) Please create a Posit Cloud (formerly RStudio Cloud) account before the first class. We have sent you a link to access all exercises on Posit Cloud. Since we want you to start coding very early on in the first class, please ensure that you can access those course materials on Posit Cloud before our first meeting. If you have any questions, please reach out to one of us through the e-mail addresses on the bottom of this page. 0.6 Schedule This workshop alternates between lecture-style presentations and application exercises. In those hands-on exercises, you will actively try out the discussed tools and techniques in Zoom breakout rooms. We aim to adhere to the following schedule. Depending on our progress, we may discuss some parts a bit earlier or later during the course.

Thanks to the #rstats education community who have made numerous suggestions for this resource, Lee Suddaby and Zeno Kujawa, for converting the homework assignments to learnr tutorials and Müge Çetinkaya for the hex logo! This website is built with bookdown, the lovely icons by icons8, and none of this would be possible without the tidyverse. "],["hello-world.html", "Chapter 1 Hello world 1.1 Slides, application exercises, and references", " Chapter 1 Hello world We will start by showing you what is possible at the end of the class and running a reasonably complex visualization code in your environment. The goal of this Hello world part is not to make you understand every bit of the code but instead to make you hungry for more. We aim for you to code such a visualization from scratch at the end of our course. To reach that goal, we will — step by step — introduce you to the most relevant facets of Data Science with R and the Tidyverse.

Source Source "],["models.html", "Chapter 5 Models 5.1 Slides, application exercises, and references", " Chapter 5 Models In this part, we will introduce you to the tidyverse-way of modeling. We will not cover the mechanics of individual statistical models but scratch the surface of a very intuitive way of coding up your models in R. You might have come across the standard way of coding up a linear regression in R — the function lm(). Instead of using lm(), we introduce you to the tidy way of linear regressions in R through the tidymodels package. This approach builds on the tidy approach to data visualization and data wrangling. We will not go through all slides during the lecture — the main focus lies on the tidy way of modeling and not the actual statistics behind it. If you want to refresh your knowledge on linear regressions, feel free to read through the remaining slides we cannot cover in the course. 5.1 Slides, application exercises, and references Unit 4 - Deck 2: Fitting and interpreting models Slides IMS :: Chp 3 - Introduction to linear models 5.1.1 Additional material not covered in class We will not cover this unit due to time constraints.

Due to time constraints, we could only show you the most critical aspects. To continue this course, you can access many more lecture materials (including recorded videos, interactive tutorials, and exercises) at datasciencebox.org. Check out Neuroscience Packages This course was a subject-agnostic introduction to the programming language R and the tidyverse packages. The beauty of R, however, is the vast number of subject-specific packages. For example, check out natverse, a tidyverse-inspired collection of packages for neuroanatomical data analysis. Join TechAcademy e.V. TechAcademy e.V. is a student organization at Goethe University educating students in Data Science with R or Python and Web Development. Students of all academic subjects can develop coding skills through Data Science and Web Development programs. Your course instructors are part of the organization’s management team. Feel free to join us! You can do so either as students for one of our programs (at the beginning of each semester) or as part of our voluntary team. Find more information on tech-academy.io. Follow the R Community The R community is amiable, helpful, and engaging. For example, follow #rstats on Twitter, and you will see many significant use cases, new developments, and tips and tricks you have never heard of before. Install R and RStudio locally If you have used Posit Cloud, the next step should be to set everything up on your local computer. Posit Cloud is excellent for getting started with R without worrying about installing anything locally. You should set up R and RStudio locally on your computer for more significant projects. Version Control with Git If you’re serious about data science, you will need Git. Better learn it early and start enjoying and appreciating it before it’s too late and you’re pressured into learning it on the fly! You should version every project you do with Git. Regardless if you’re working alone or with a big group of developers. Regardless if you write ten lines of code or a complex program. With Git, you can keep track of all your changes. It’s like a Dropbox/Google Drive for developers. Pro-Tip: Get free GitHub Pro as a student with the GitHub Student Developer Pack. RStudio has a friendly interface that lets you enjoy the perks of Git without ever having to touch the command line – sounds great, does it? Learn to set up the Git &amp; R workflow with Happy Git with R. Inspiration and Tools for Great Visualizations Get inspiration to take your plotting to the next level at the R Graph Gallery. The gallery also includes code to reproduce the plots. R and RStudio are two uniquely customizable tools. For example, RStudio allows Add-ins that sometimes offer simplified access to certain tools or techniques. In the visualization context, two of those extensions are esquisse for a graphical interface to ggplot2 ggx for easy ggplot2 help. See what else is possible in R R and RStudio are potent tools to do many things beyond traditional Data Science. For example, we wrote all course materials (including the website and slides) in R Markdown. You can also write your doctoral thesis in R Markdown tools without leaving RStudio. Everything from data analysis to results communication can be implemented and connected, so you never have to manually paste tables or figures into a Word document. You can find many valuable references at RStudio Education. "]]
